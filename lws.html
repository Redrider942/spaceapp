    <h1>Communication</h1>
    <p>When astronauts need to phone home from the space station,
        they use the Softphone via a laptop computer. The system
        uses Internet Protocol (IP) information packets to route the
        signals and, when connected, astronauts can use the
        computer keypad to dial any number and call anyone they
        wish. They speak through a headset with a microphone. The
        distance can mean there is a time lag of up to one second in
        conversations.</p>

    <h1>Working</h1>
    <p>Space shuttle and space station crews put in a lot of overtime
        when they are in space. The average workday for an astronaut
        in space is 16 hours, and they are on call 24 hours a day.
        The shuttle crew’s activities include conducting experiments,
        assembling the station and maintaining the shuttle while in
        space. The shuttle crews also conduct missions that involve
        the release, capture or repair of satellites. The shuttle’s
        average flight time is two and a half weeks, a short time in
        comparison to the six to nine months Expedition crews
        spend on the station.</p>

        <h1>Health and Hygeine</h1>
        <p>Zero gravity and a sunrise every 90 minutes can
            disrupt an astronaut’s health, both physically and
            mentally. The crew must combat motion sickness,
            claustrophobia and homesickness every day. They
            also must be prepared for any medical emergencies
            that may arise.Astronauts don’t have to worry about germs like on
            Earth; the only germs aboard the space shuttle or
            the International Space Station are the ones they
            take with them. But that doesn’t mean they won’t
            get sick. Zero gravity causes the fluids in your body
            to rise to your head, which feels like a constant
            head cold.</p>
