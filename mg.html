    <h1>What is Microgravity?</h1>
    <p class="mg">Microgravity is when things seem to be weightless. “Micro-” means “very small.” Microgravity is when the pull of gravity is not very strong. In microgravity, it is easy to move heavy objects</p>
    <h1>Why Does NASA Study Microgravity?</h2>
    <p class="mg">NASA studies microgravity. The studies help show what happens to people and other things in space. Microgravity does things to the human body. For example, muscles and bones can get weaker. Astronauts on the space station spend months in microgravity. Astronauts who travel to Mars would have to live even longer in microgravity. That is because it will take a long time to get there and back. NASA must learn what microgravity does to astronauts. NASA will use this information to find ways to keep them safe and healthy.</p>
    <p class="mg">Other things seem to act differently in microgravity, too. Fire burns in a different shape. Without gravity, flames are more round. Crystals grow better. Their shapes are more perfect without gravity. NASA performs science experiments in microgravity. They help NASA learn things that would be hard to learn on Earth.</p>
    <h1>Can Microgravity Be Found on Earth?</h3>
    <p class="mg">Microgravity can be found on Earth, too. NASA uses airplanes to create microgravity for a short time. The airplane does this by flying in up-and-down parabolas. At the top of the parabola, people and things inside the airplane are in free fall for about 20-30 seconds. NASA also uses drop towers to study microgravity. Objects are dropped from the top of these towers. The objects are in free fall as they drop. You can even experience microgravity yourself. How? You can go over a big hill on a roller coaster or ride on a free-fall ride at an amusement park.</p>
